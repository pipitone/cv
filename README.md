## Education
- **MD Candidate (2016-2020), Queen's University School of Medicine**

- **MSc. Computer Science (2007-2010), University of Toronto**  
    Thesis: "On software quality in climate modelling"

- **Hon BSc. Computer Science (2000-2004), University of Toronto**

## Interests

- **Cycling**: Two weeks good, four wheels bad. Commute everywhere via bicycle
  year-round. Taken several long bike trips (e.g. Toronto to Thunder Bay,
Toronto to Montreal, Portland to San Francisco). Critical Mass participant.
Self-taught bicycle maintenance. 
- **Cooking & baking**. Curiously protective of my cast-iron pan. Mostly
   vegetarian. Prefer to make things from scratch, e.g. bread, dumplings, ramen,
pasta, tortillas. Organized a student-led vegan cafe during grad school. My
family runs an "Iron Chef" competition every Christmas. 
- **Meditation**: 20+ year eclectic interest in meditation and buddhism (Mahayana,
  Vipassana). Regularly listen to Buddhist audio lectures. Ran daily morning
meditation sessions during pre-clerkship. Audited classes at U of Toronto on
the cognitive science behind mediation.
- **Reading**: who reads books anymore? I try, but now often "experience" books as
   audiobooks. Last book: The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt.
- **Running**
- **Yoga**
- **Camping and hiking**
- **Seinfeld**
- **Physics & Mathematics**
- **Programming**
