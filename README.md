## Work
- **Research Methods Specialist**, 2012-2016  
  *Kimel Lab, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto*

	Research in automated MRI image segmentation of the hippocampus, machine
learning approaches to understanding hippocampus shape changes in Alzheimer's
disease, classification of deficit/non-deficit schizophrenia from DWI white
matter measures and tractography.

- **Research Intern**, 2011-2012   
  *Kimel Lab, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto*

	Research on automated MRI image segmentation techniques for the hippocampus
and subfields. Also responsible for setup and management of lab cluster
computing resources. 

- **Course Developer**, 2012  
  *Mozilla, Toronto* 

	Developed course materials for the Python programming lessons of the
Software Carpentry project <http://software-carpentry.org>.  

- **Software Developer**, 2006-2007  
  *The Jonah Group, Toronto*

  *Adoption-Centric Reverse Engineering Lab, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC*

	Developed a web-based tool for software reverse engineering and conducted
user studies. 

## Interests

- **Cycling**: Two wheels good, four wheels bad. Commute everywhere via bicycle year-round. Taken several long bike trips (e.g. Toronto to Thunder Bay, Toronto to Montreal, Portland to San Francisco). Critical Mass participant.  Self-taught bicycle maintenance. 
- **Cooking & baking**. Curiously protective of my cast-iron pan. Mostly vegetarian. Prefer to make things from scratch, e.g. bread, dumplings, ramen, pasta, tortillas. Organized a student-led vegan cafe during grad school. My family runs an "Iron Chef" competition every Christmas. 
- **Meditation**: 20+ year eclectic interest in meditation and Buddhism (Mahayana, Vipassana). Regularly listen to Buddhist audio lectures. Ran daily morning meditation sessions during pre-clerkship. Audited classes at U of Toronto on the cognitive science behind mediation.
- **Yoga**: 15+ years of Iyengar yoga. Mostly practice on my own.
- **Reading**: Who reads books anymore? I try, but now often "experience" books as audiobooks. Last book: The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt.
- **Running**: I used to be a competitive cross-country runner, and I still wish I were in some ways. Now I run a few times a week for the joy of it.  5-10km, trails > roads. 
- **Camping & hiking**: Either as part of a bike trip, or on backcountry with canoes and boots. Favourite place: Killarney Provincial Park, ON. 
- **Seinfeld**: I think this show plays on continuous loop in my head at all times. Big fan.
- **Programming**: My past life. I try to stay up to date by reading about and tinkering with the latest in software development, and have a few side projects (<https://github.com/pipitone>).
